Design and implement mySQL database and create UI to query, edit and display data using Python.

Let’s build</br>
Run this .py file with internet turned on, after reading
below steps :<br>

<br><br>
Our software is a standalone software, which means
running the python file shared above will launch the
software, if you have python installed in your system along
with the dependency python library and your internet is
connected:<br>
- tk or tkinter<br>
- python-mysql-connector<br>
- pillow<br>
- numpy<br><br>
You can install these libraries with help of pip on
windows/linux/macos. (mysql connector is installed with
package manager in tested arch based linux machines)<br><br>
Our mysql database temporarily hosted online at
https://www.freemysqlhosting.net, if it is expired then this
won’t work, so in that case use this .sql file to import the
database somewhere<br>
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DX59FUJD8wmMUoKzv2Zx_X7xTg9Ty3I/view?usp=sharing<br>
and then change these variables inside .py file to your
own credentials.<br>
